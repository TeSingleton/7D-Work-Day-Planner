# Work Day Planner-work in progress

## A web app designed to help people schedule out their day. 
A work day planner built with Third party APIs to test my working knowledge. 
A feature of this planner is that its color coded for the time of day. 
Green for Future events, Gray  for past events, and Red for the Current time. 
Once your schedule is saved, it will be available to you upon return/reload of the page


## Work Completed.
* Added and manipulated Moment.js for time keeping on web app
* I used Javascript to create and appened the schedule with help from https://github.com/thenickedwards/work-day-scheduler/blob/main/Assets/script.js
* Local storage for scheduled tasks added to project.

## Work to be completed 
* At the moment my planner is giving me a bug of only highlighting for future events. 
  I have tried various methods that I've researched online and have , at the current moment i have been unable to make it work. 
* I am turning the project in incomplete to stay current with my class and will return to resubmit once I have gathered more information.
